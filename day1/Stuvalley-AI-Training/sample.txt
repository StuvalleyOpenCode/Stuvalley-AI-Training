Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved significantly over the past few decades. 
Early AI systems were rule-based, meaning they followed predefined instructions and couldn’t adapt to new information. 
However, with the rise of Machine Learning, AI began to learn from data instead of relying on fixed rules.

One major breakthrough was the development of Neural Networks, which mimic the human brain. 
These networks improved AI’s ability to recognize patterns, understand language, and generate human-like text. 
Models like Word2Vec (2013) introduced word embeddings, allowing AI to understand word relationships better. 

Later, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) allowed AI to process sequential data, making them useful for language understanding. 
However, RNNs struggled with long sentences, as they tended to forget earlier parts of the text.

In 2017, Transformers changed everything. They introduced the self-attention mechanism, which helped AI focus on important words in a sentence. 
This led to the development of GPT models, which can generate human-like responses based on the context.

Today, AI-powered applications like chatbots, translation tools, and text summarization models are widely used in various industries. 
As AI continues to advance, the future holds even more exciting possibilities!
